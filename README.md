# DevSecOps-fu

<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/mpiotrak/docs/blob/adding_golang_notes/_screenshots/devsecops.png" alt="devsecops.piping"> </p>

Following repository is the collection of notes I've been taking once decided to first become DevOps and later on (mighty) DevSecOps engineer:ninja:. The way I always tended to learn anything, no matter if in high school, then uni and now in so-called "adult life" was taking notes, even if it meant to re-write what I've read in books[^1], materials (mainly official documentation or Medium/Faun/Dev[^2] articles) or got from online courses (mainly Pluralsight[^3]). By far I was taking notes in Google Drive, but GitHub seems much more accessible, and it allows me practicing markdown almost on a daily basis.

Schedule on what I'm now working on, or I plan to add will be placed in the RoadMap:point_up:

If only the information gathered here will help someone gain some useful knowledge, I will be more than happy to hear so!:heart:
