# Overview <a name="paragraph1"></a>

Following repository is the collection of notes I've been taking since the day I decided to first become DevOps and later on (mighty) DevSecOps engineer! :ninja: The way I always tended to learn anything, no matter if in high school, then uni and now in so-called "adult life" was taking notes, even if it meant to re-write what I've read in books[^1], materials (mainly official documentation or Medium/Faun/Dev[^2] articles) or got from online courses (mainly Pluralsight[^3]). By far I was taking notes in Google Drive, but GitHub seems much more accessible, and it allows me practicing markdown almost on a daily basis, so here we are :wink:

Schedule on what I'm working on now, or plan to add will be updated in the [Road Map](https://github.com/mpiotrak/DevSecOps-fu/projects/1) :point_up:

If only the information gathered here will help someone gain some useful knowledge or understand something better, I will be more than happy to hear so! :heart:

Any suggestions or insights are more than welcome!


## cheatsheets

Handy templates on how to use some of languages - mainly yaml and markup. No matter how often I use them there is always something I can't remember, therefore this easy way of refreshing memory :wink:


## vault

Combined official Hashicorp documentation, course content from Pluralsight's certification path for Hashicorp Vault and my observations/insights (i.e "How-to" or "Commands" sections).
