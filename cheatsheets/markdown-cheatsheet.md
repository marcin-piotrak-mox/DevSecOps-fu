## Headers

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

HTML-styled headers

<h1>HTML-styled header H1</h1>
<h3>HTML-styled header H3</h3>

Alternatively styled headers (works only for H1 and H2, requires any number of `==` or `--` underneath header name)

Heading 1
==

Heading 2
--

### Heading IDs

###### My Great Heading

<h6 id="html-heading-id">My Great HTML-styled Heading</h3>

Linking to Heading IDs:
- [Link to my great heading](#my-great-heading)
- <a href="#html-heading-id">Link to my great HTML-styled heading</a>
- [Link to other website's heading](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#heading-ids)


## Line Breaks

Here's a line to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by **two newlines**, so it will be a **separate paragraph**. Adding more than two newlines **will not** result with additional space between paragraphs.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

`&nbsp;` - 1 space<br>
`&ensp;` - 2 spaces<br>
`&emsp;` - 3 spaces<br>

`<br>` - HTML-styled line brake - equivalent to two newlines.


## Text manipulation

Italics (emphasis) are made with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Bold (strong emphasis) is made with **double asterisks** or __double underscores__.

Combined emphasis is made with **_asterisks and underscores_** or ***triple asterisks***.

~~Strikethrough~~ is made with tildes.

<samp>Monospaced text.</samp>

<ins>Underlined text.</ins>

<table><tr><td>Boxed text.</td></tr></table>

Normal and <sub>subscripted text.</sub>

Normal and <sup>superscripted text.</sup>

```
<!--
Commented out text.

```

@person_mentioning

#prs_or_issues_mentioning

:exclamation: Exclamation sign. :question: Question sign. :warning: Warning sign.

[Emoji's list](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md "Emoji's list")


## Code and Syntax Highlighting

**Inline code** has single back-ticks around it - (`).

**Code blocks** can be created by indenting lines by **four spaces** or **one tab**.

**Fenced code blocks** (```) allow the same with disregard to indenting and additionally supports **syntax highlighting**:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```


## Blackquotes

> This is a single line of blackquote.
> This is a newline of blackquote - it will be part of the same blackquote.

> This is a newline of blacqoute separated from previous with empty line.

> This is a first line of multiline blacqoute.
>
> This is a third line of of multiline blacqoute. Middle line only has `>` sign. Hey it also **supports** _markdown_.
> - Like nested lists for example.

> This is a first line of multiline **nested** blacqoute.
>> This is first nested line.
>>> #### This is second nested line marked as header. It can go on and on.


## Alignments

Text or image alignments can be done using HTML tags.

Image alignment:
<p align="right">

Text alignment:
<h5 align="center">Centered text.</h5>

### Tables

Markdown-styled tables with headers and different pipes/dashes alignment

| Default | Left align | Center align | Right align |
| - | :- | :-: | -: |
| 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 |
| _9999999_ | 9999999 | 9999999 | 9999999 |

| Default    | Left align | Center align      | Right align |
| ---------- | :--------- | :----------:      | ----------: |
| 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999        | 9999999999  |
| 9999999    | 9999999    | http://google.com | 9999999     |

Default    | Left align | Center align | Right align
---------- | :--------- | :----------: | ----------:
9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999   | 9999999999
9999999    | 9999999    | 9999999      | `9999999`

Markdown-styled table rules:
-  dashes `-` create each columnâ€™s header
-  pipes `|` separate each column
- any number of dashes and spaces can be used to increase readability
- text alignment is done by adding a colon `:` to the left, right, or on both side of the dashes within the header row
- outer pipes `|` are optional
- lines don't need to be fixed up prettily, inline-styled lines are also accepted
- markdown formattin is acceptable - links, code (words or phrases in backticks (`) only, not code blocks), and emphasis
- HTML character code (&#124;) to display a pipe character in a table

## Footnotes

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^multiline_footnote]

[^1]: First footnote.
[^multiline_footnote]: Footnote with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Paragraphs need to be indented to be included in multiline footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Another **paragraph**.


## Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks `***`, dashes `---`, or underscores `___` on a line by themselves - for compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules, otherwise it can be treated as heading.
